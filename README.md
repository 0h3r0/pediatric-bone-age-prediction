# First Task Deadline
20th of April !!!
* Lukas: Installation of dataset on cluster and installation of baseline program of kevin mader
* LÃ©onard: Preprocessing of images
* Joel: Investigate transfer learning datasets 
* Ya:  Implement and test other network approaches for the problem (resnet, vgg, etc.)

# Project Deadline
15th of May !!!

# Report and Presentation Deadline
20th of May !!!

# Presentation Day
22th of May !!!

# Tasks
* Port the existing code of one of kevin maders kernels to torch so we can see our starting point (must be done fast!)
* Try transfer learning with other medical datasets (mura stanford, chestxray nih, etc. )
* Try Preprocessing of images (noise, rotation, etc. )
* Try different architectures of the used net
* Make model highlight joints 
* Incorporate gender into model
* Build model on top of model to predict accuracy of age model
* Try combining different architectures/approaches with meta learning (e.g. voting)
