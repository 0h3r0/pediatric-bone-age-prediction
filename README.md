Based on kaggle RSNA Bone Age Prediction from X-Rays

# Tasks
1. Port the existing code of one of kevin maders kernels to torch so we can see our starting point (must be done fast!)
2. Make model highlight joints 3. Incorporate gender into model
4. Try transfer learning with other medical datasets (mura stanford, chestxray nih, etc. )
5. Build model on top of model to predict accuracy of age model
6. Try Preprocessing of images (noise, rotation, etc. )
7. Try different architectures of the used net
8. Try combining different architectures/approaches with meta learning (e.g. voting)
